Builder design pattern:
It focuses on creating a complex object from the simple object step by step.
Major objects:
1. Complex object/ final product: eg house , complex object we create with the help of builder design pattern.
2. Builder : abstract class/ interface , which will create the complex object.
It has getFinalPeoduct which will return the final complex object.
3. ConcreteBuilders: these are different builder implementation classes which will provide the complex objects to create.
4. Director: control object creation. 1 st call the appropriate concrete builde r then 2 nd return the complex object.
